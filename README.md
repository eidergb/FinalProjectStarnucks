# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the behavior of users of the Starbucks rewards app by leveraging historical data from their interactions with various promotional offers. The primary goal is to understand how different user demographic characteristics influence their response to different types of offers, such as BOGO (Buy One Get One), discounts, and informational offers. Predictive models and recommendation systems were developed to personalize offers, thereby maximizing their effectiveness.

## Motivation
The project aims to identify which user characteristics, such as age, gender, and income level, are correlated with a higher likelihood of completing specific promotional offers. By personalizing these offers according to demographic profiles, we can significantly increase the conversion rate, thus enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. This understanding is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies and offer distribution.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Mathematical and array operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models, feature selection, and preprocessing.
- `json`: Loading data from JSON format.

## Repository Files
- `portfolio.json`: Contains offer IDs and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
    - Fields: id, offer_type, difficulty, reward, duration, channels.
- `profile.json`: Demographic data for each customer.
    - Fields: age, became_member_on, gender, id, income.
- `transcript.json`: Records of transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
    - Fields: event, person, time, value.

## Metrics
- `Completion Rate`: Measures the percentage of completed offers from those viewed or received. It evaluates offer effectiveness, identifying which are most appealing. Notably, discount offers had the highest completion rate, indicating strong motivational impact.
- `View vs. Received Rate`: Compares offers viewed to those received, assessing user engagement. A high view rate suggests effective capture of user attention, while a low rate may indicate a need for better targeting.
- `Correlation Analysis`: Explores relationships between features like reward and difficulty with the completion rate. This helps identify factors influencing user behavior, such as the potential deterrent effect of higher rewards linked to more challenging offers.
- `Response Rate by Demographics`: Analyzes offer response rates based on demographics (age, gender, income). This is crucial for tailoring marketing strategies and personalizing offers for more effective targeting.
- `Multiple Linear Regression Analysis`: Quantifies the relationship between independent variables (e.g., reward, difficulty) and completion rate. It provides insights for predicting user response to different offer attributes.
- `Accuracy`: Provides an overall measure of the model's performance in classifying test data. While useful for a general assessment, it should be interpreted cautiously in imbalanced datasets.
- `Precision`: Indicates the proportion of true positives among predicted positives, crucial for minimizing false positives in marketing, thus optimizing resource allocation.
- `Recall`: Measures the proportion of correctly identified true positives, ensuring most completed offers are captured, crucial for maximizing campaign effectiveness.
- `F1-Score`: Balances precision and recall, offering a more comprehensive view of performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.
- `Confusion Matrix`: Visualizes model performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping to identify and address specific error areas.
- `Cosine Similarity`: Measures the similarity between users based on interactions, vital for recommending offers that similar users have completed, supporting collaborative filtering in the recommender system.

## Summary of Results
- Demographic Segmentation: It was found that different genders, ages, and income levels respond differently to offers. For instance, females have a higher response rate than males​.
- Offer Effectiveness: BOGO and discount offers were observed to be more effective. Informational offers, though less frequent, also play an important role in Starbucks' marketing strategy​.
- Predictive Models: The Gradient Boosting model was identified as the most suitable for predicting whether a customer would complete an offer, achieving an overall accuracy of 70%​.

## Conclusion
The recommendation system based on the predictive models developed can significantly improve the efficiency of Starbucks' marketing strategies by offering personalized recommendations and increasing user engagement. Challenges such as missing data and outliers were identified, suggesting opportunities to improve model accuracy by using more advanced machine learning techniques and incorporating additional data​.
