# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the behavior of users of the Starbucks rewards app by leveraging historical data from their interactions with various promotional offers. The primary goal is to understand how different user demographic characteristics influence their response to different types of offers, such as BOGO (Buy One Get One), discounts, and informational offers. Predictive models and recommendation systems were developed to personalize offers, thereby maximizing their effectiveness.

## Motivation
The project aims to identify which user characteristics, such as age, gender, and income level, are correlated with a higher likelihood of completing specific promotional offers. By personalizing these offers according to demographic profiles, we can significantly increase the conversion rate, thus enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. This understanding is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies and offer distribution.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Mathematical and array operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models, feature selection, and preprocessing.
- `json`: Loading data from JSON format.

## Repository Files
- portfolio.json: Contains offer IDs and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
    - Fields: id, offer_type, difficulty, reward, duration, channels.
- profile.json: Demographic data for each customer.
    - Fields: age, became_member_on, gender, id, income.
- transcript.json: Records of transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
    - Fields: event, person, time, value.

## Summary of Results
- Demographic Segmentation: It was found that different genders, ages, and income levels respond differently to offers. For instance, females have a higher response rate than males​.
- Offer Effectiveness: BOGO and discount offers were observed to be more effective. Informational offers, though less frequent, also play an important role in Starbucks' marketing strategy​.
- Predictive Models: The Gradient Boosting model was identified as the most suitable for predicting whether a customer would complete an offer, achieving an overall accuracy of 70%​.

## Conclusion
The recommendation system based on the predictive models developed can significantly improve the efficiency of Starbucks' marketing strategies by offering personalized recommendations and increasing user engagement. Challenges such as missing data and outliers were identified, suggesting opportunities to improve model accuracy by using more advanced machine learning techniques and incorporating additional data​.
